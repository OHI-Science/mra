## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

  1.1.Import dataset

eco_prep: units FCP, Total revenue generated by summing value added tax (CA TVA data). Source: *Comptes économiques* - ISPF. [Institut de la statistique de la Polynésie française](http://www.ispf.pf/). It is without being adjusted by the national revenues.

1.2. Data preparation
CV TVA is adjusted by *PIB réel* (≅GDP)

First, we calculated the adjusted revenue generated per sector and year.

Second, absolutes values for revenues were groupped together in the current year and reference points.

**This way is the same as for OHI methods, right?**
#ECO trend
For the trend calculation, revenues from the different sectors over the most recent five years are considered (not summed sectors), and corrected by GDP
[Check Baltic trend calculation alternative 3](https://github.com/OHI-Science/bhi-1.0-archive/blob/draft/baltic2015/prep/ECO/eco_prep.md#status-alternative-1--> they did in another way.
Below it is from hawaii
check!!!

Hawaii trend, why just one value!! It is checked, has to be just one value but global assessment and bhi have more because it means the different scenarios year?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
 # ECO trend
  eco_trend = rev_adj_sector %>%
    filter(!is.na(rev_adj)) %>%
    filter(year >= max(year, na.rm=T) - 4 ) %>% # 5 year trend
    # get sector weight as total revenue across years for given region
    arrange(rgn_id, year, Sector) %>%
    group_by(rgn_id, Sector) %>%
    mutate(
      weight = sum(rev_adj, na.rm=T)) %>%
    # get linear model coefficient per region-sector
    group_by(rgn_id, Sector, weight) %>%
    do(mdl = lm(rev_adj ~ year, data=.)) %>%
    summarize(
      weight = weight,
      rgn_id = rgn_id,
      sector = Sector,
      # TODO: consider how the units affect trend; should these be normalized? cap per sector or later?
      sector_trend = pmax(-1, pmin(1, coef(mdl)[['year']] * 5))) %>%
    # get weighted mean across sectors per region
    group_by(rgn_id) %>%
    summarize(
      score = weighted.mean(sector_trend, weight, na.rm=T)) %>%
    # format
    mutate(
      goal      = 'ECO',
      dimension = 'trend') %>%
    dplyr::select(
      goal, dimension,
      region_id = rgn_id,
      score)

write_csv(eco_trend, 'eco_trend.csv')

#Calculate trend
eco_trend1 <-eco_status %>%
   filter(year >= 2013) %>%
   filter(!is.na(score)) %>%
   group_by(rgn_id) %>%
   arrange(year) %>%
   top_n(5, year) %>%
   ungroup()

 eco_trend1 <- eco_trend1 %>%
   group_by(rgn_id) %>%
   do(mdl = lm(score ~ year, data=.)) %>%
   summarize(region_id = rgn_id,
              trend = coef(mdl)['year']*5) %>%

```

##Observations
Hawaii script was the one I could make work and also the most understandable!
They used the adjusted revenue,**should trend be calculated using status value and not rev_adj??**
I did not find the script for the global assessment

The way it is done in trend1 it is how it is usually calculated the trend. Is it correct? Not becasue the sectors are all summed and in the trend, they take into account the individual values. So it would be Hawaii way.
